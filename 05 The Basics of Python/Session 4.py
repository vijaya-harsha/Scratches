#  For Loop example

for i in range(1,10):
    print(i)

# for loop syntax is nearly same as the bash but there is some change in  syntax
# for i in range (min,max):

a=5
b=6

for c in range(1,a*b):
    print(c)

# range dont accept float values .. as a/b will return float value in below example
a=12
b=3

for c in range(1,a/b)
    print(c)

# In below example , we can see a//b returns an int value.

for d in range(1,a//b):
    print(d)
